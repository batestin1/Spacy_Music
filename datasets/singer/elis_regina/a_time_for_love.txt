ELIS REGINA - A TIME FOR LOVE

A time for summer skies, for humming birds and weather time
For tender words that harmonize with mine
A time for climbing hills, for learning out of window sills
Admiring the daffodils above
A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow - colored weather
A time of make-believe that will mean men in love
As time goes drifting by the river bend
And sรณ do l - as all my friends whatever sky above
l know the time for friends
A time for all, the best of all
A time for love
