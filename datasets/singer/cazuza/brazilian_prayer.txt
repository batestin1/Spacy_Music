CAZUZA - BRAZILIAN PRAYER

I've been following you
Since I was born
Counting my fingers
Facing the fears
I've been so anxious
And sad
You must belive, it's serious
All my days are like
Cruel rainy days in the hot summer
Ande it hurts me, baby
Hurts like a knife in my eyes
Like a shot of sadness
I live in madness
I'm really crazy
Living without tenderness
Nobody even looks at me
I've been following you, baby
Since I was born
In this fuking world
I come to know you
I'm here to love you
Understand me
Trust me
Project me
Have pity on me
